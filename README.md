# Mariner

**A file manager that feels exactly like GNOME Files — and finally has the power
features it always refused to add.**

Mariner is a native GTK4 + libadwaita file manager for the GNOME desktop. It
drives the same widgets as [GNOME Files](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/nautilus)
(Nautilus), so it looks and behaves like home — then adds dual-pane browsing, a
Quick Look preview, a command palette, full-text search, and a built-in disk
analyzer on top.

## Why switch?

You already know how to use Mariner: the sidebar, breadcrumbs, tabs, grid/list
views, right-click menus, and keyboard shortcuts all match GNOME Files. Nothing
to relearn.

The difference is everything Nautilus users have asked for and never got — split
view, a Space-bar preview, a command palette, real full-text search — shipped in
one app that still looks like stock GNOME.

## The big features

### Dual-pane split view

Two folders side by side. Copy or move between them with a keypress, drag files
across, and `F6` (or `Alt+W`) to jump between panes. The single most-requested
GNOME Files feature — the reason people reach for Krusader or Total Commander.

- Toggle split: **F3**
- Copy to other pane: **Ctrl+Shift+C** · Move to other pane: **Ctrl+Shift+X**

</p>

### Quick Look preview

Press **Space** on any file to preview it instantly — images, video and audio,
text and source code — without launching a heavy app. Arrow keys page through the
whole folder. It's Finder's best feature, built in and always there (no flaky
`sushi` dependency).

</p>

### Command palette

Press **Ctrl+P** and run any command or jump to any recently-visited folder from
the keyboard — VS Code for your files. Fuzzy-ranked, and folders are ordered by
*frecency* (how often and how recently you visit them), so the place you want is
usually the first hit.

</p>

### Full-text search

Recursive search that streams matches as it finds them. Flip on **Contents** in
the search filter to grep *inside* files with [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) —
fast, no background indexer required. Narrow by type (folders, images, documents,
music, video) and by date (today, this week, this month, this year).

- Search: **Ctrl+F**

</p>

### Built-in disk usage analyzer

Right-click any folder → **Analyze Disk Usage** for a Baobab-style radial sunburst
of what's eating your space. Hover to inspect, click a wedge to drill in. No need
to install a separate app.

</p>

### Custom actions

Add your own commands to the right-click menu — open a project in your editor,
optimize the selected images, run any script against the selection. Define them
in a small JSON file and they show up in the context menu, matched to the
selection by type, extension, or count. Nautilus dropped its scripting support
years ago; Mariner brings it back. See
[Configuring custom actions](#configuring-custom-actions) for the format.

## Everything that's different from GNOME Files

Beyond the headliners above, a low-density rundown of what Mariner does that
Nautilus doesn't (or does differently):

- **Split view** — two panes in one tab, with cross-pane copy/move and drag.
- **Quick Look** — Space-to-preview for images, audio/video, text and code.
- **Command palette** — Ctrl+P to run any action or jump to a folder.
- **Frecency folder jumping** — recent folders ranked by frequency × recency.
- **Full-text search** — grep inside files via ripgrep, no indexing daemon.
- **Disk usage analyzer** — interactive sunburst chart, built in.
- **Custom actions** — add your own scripts to the context menu, matched to the
  selection by type, extension, or count.
- **Computer view** — every drive and partition with a live capacity bar.
- **Vim cursor keys** — `Alt+H`/`J`/`K`/`L` move the selection like arrows.
- **Operations queue** — each running copy/move/archive shown separately, with its
  own progress and cancel button.
- **Batch rename** — find-and-replace or numbered patterns, with live preview.
- **Extract & compress** — extract zip, tar.*, 7z and rar; compress to zip,
  tar.*, or 7z, straight from the right-click menu.
- **Reset zoom** — `Ctrl+0` snaps grid icons back to the default size.
- **Set as wallpaper**, **Open in Terminal**, **Create Link**, **Restore from
  Trash** — one click from the context menu.

Everything else — tabs, bookmarks, the places sidebar, mounted volumes, trash,
undo/redo, thumbnails, properties, sorting, hidden-file toggle, drag-and-drop,
customizable list columns — works just like GNOME Files.

## Install

### Arch Linux (AUR)

```sh
# with an AUR helper
paru -S mariner-git      # or: yay -S mariner-git

# or manually
git clone https://aur.archlinux.org/mariner-git.git && cd mariner-git
makepkg -si
```

Mariner then appears in your application menu. To make it your default file
manager:

```sh
xdg-mime default com.github.nodegtk.mariner.desktop inode/directory
```

### From source

Requires **Node ≥ 22.18**, **GTK ≥ 4.16**, and **libadwaita ≥ 1.5**, plus a C
toolchain and the GTK / GObject-Introspection headers (to build the native
bindings on first install). [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) is
optional — it enables full-text (in-file) search.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/romgrk/mariner.git && cd mariner
npm install      # fetches and builds node-gtk
npm start
```

## Usage

Launch Mariner from your application menu, or open a folder from the terminal:

```sh
mariner ~/Documents          # installed
npm start -- ~/Documents     # from source
```

Press **Ctrl+?** at any time for the full keyboard-shortcuts window. A few worth
knowing up front:

| Shortcut | Action |
| --- | --- |
| **Ctrl+P** | Command palette |
| **Ctrl+F** | Search (add **Contents** filter for full-text) |
| **Space** | Quick Look preview |
| **F3** | Toggle split view |
| **F6** / **Alt+W** | Focus the other pane |
| **Ctrl+L** | Type a path |
| **Ctrl+1** / **Ctrl+2** | List / grid view |
| **F2** | Rename (batch rename with a multi-selection) |

### Configuring custom actions

You can add your own commands to the file-view context menu. Create
`~/.config/mariner/actions.json` (honouring `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`) with a list of
actions:

```json
{
  "actions": [
    { "label": "Open in VS Code", "command": "code %F" },
    {
      "label": "Optimize PNGs",
      "command": "optipng %F",
      "mimeTypes": ["image/png"],
      "selection": "any"
    },
    {
      "label": "New note here",
      "command": "gnome-text-editor \"$(mktemp %d/note-XXXX.md)\"",
      "selection": "none"
    }
  ]
}
```

Each action needs a `label` and a `command`; the rest are optional and control
when the action appears:

| Field         | Meaning                                                            | Default |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `selection`   | `none` (empty area), `single`, `multiple`, or `any` selected item | `any`   |
| `mimeTypes`   | only when every selected item matches one of these globs          | any     |
| `extensions`  | only when every selected item has one of these extensions         | any     |
| `directories` | set to `false` to hide when a folder is selected                  | `true`  |
| `files`       | set to `false` to hide when a regular file is selected            | `true`  |

The `command` runs through `/bin/sh` from the current folder, with these tokens
substituted (each safely shell-quoted):

| Token | Expands to             | Token | Expands to           |
| ----- | ---------------------- | ----- | -------------------- |
| `%f`  | first selected path    | `%F`  | all selected paths   |
| `%u`  | first selected URI     | `%U`  | all selected URIs    |
| `%n`  | first selected name    | `%N`  | all selected names   |
| `%d`  | current folder path    | `%%`  | a literal `%`        |

With nothing selected, `%f`/`%F`/`%u`/`%U` fall back to the current folder. The
file is re-read every time you open the context menu, so edits take effect
without restarting Mariner.
